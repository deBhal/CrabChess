=====================

This game is one of the simplest interpretations of the "Self-Modifying Game" described by Douglas Hofstadter in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach"><em>GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach</em></a>, wherein	the rules of a game are encoded in the positions of the peices on a chess-board.<p/>

In this instantiation, only the movements of the pieces change, and valid moves are determined by the relative position of the player's pieces.  Otherwise, we use chess-like captures, alternating turns and an annihilation victory condition ( although only movements and captures are currently implemented ).
