Crab Chess
=====================

In his book _GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach_ Douglas Hofstadter describes a "Crab Chess", which I've implemented here.

In the self-referential spirit of the book, the rules of Crab Chess are that the positions of the pieces determine the available moves.

In this implementation, the relative positions of all of a players pieces describe the available moves.  For example, if a player has two pieces that are horizontally adjacent, then all that players pieces may move one square to the left or right.  If the two pieces are separated by one square, then all the player's pieces can jump one square to the left or right.

Click on a piece to select it, and you'll see all the available moves lit up in green.

I find the result quite interesting, I hope you do too.
